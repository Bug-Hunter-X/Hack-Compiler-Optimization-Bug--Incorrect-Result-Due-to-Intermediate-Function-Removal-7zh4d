The solution requires modification to the Hack compiler itself.  This is not easily demonstrated in a code snippet.  The compiler needs to be enhanced to prevent the premature removal of intermediate functions.  Possible solutions within the compiler include:

1. **Improved Inlining:**  More sophisticated inlining strategies that consider the potential impact on correctness during optimization.
2. **Data Flow Analysis:**  More thorough data flow analysis to properly propagate the results of intermediate functions and avoid incorrect code generation during optimization.
3. **Optimization Level Control:**  Exposing compiler flags or settings to allow developers to control the aggressiveness of the optimization process. This would allow the user to select an optimization level that prevents this type of error while still providing performance benefits. 

These changes are not easily showcased in a short code snippet; they are complex compiler modifications.
